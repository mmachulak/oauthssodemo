<p>The user is presented with an element enticing them to login. In the simplest case, you can redirect the browser to the <em>Authorization Endpoint</em> on the OpenID Connect provider. You can do that in a popup, which is probably better.</p>
<p>As a developer, you should not construct the URI for the OpenID Connect provider by yourself. Instead, such a URI will be constructed for you by the library.</p>
<p><strong>NOTICE:</strong> The login element on your page can be a direct link to the OpenID Connect provider, generated by the library. It can also be a link to a handler within your application that redirects the user to the OpenID Connect provider. In both cases, such a link is constructed based on the provided configuration (see Step 0).</p>

<p>Sign In handler that redirects the user to the <em>Authorization Endpoint</em> at Google IDP:</p>

<pre class="brush: python;">

class SignInHandler(webapp.RequestHandler):

    def get(self):
        callback = self.request.host_url + endpoints.CALLBACK_URL
        authorize_url = IDP_FLOW.step1_get_authorize_url(callback)
        self.redirect(authorize_url)
</pre>

<div class="ui-state-highlight ui-corner-all">
    <p><span class="ui-icon ui-icon-info" style="float: left; margin-right: .3em;"></span>
        The full URL of the target (with parameters), generated by the library, is: <a href="{{ targetUrl }}" target='_blank'>{{targetUrl}}</a>
    </p>
</div>
